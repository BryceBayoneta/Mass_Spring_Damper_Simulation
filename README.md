This is a MATLAB simulation which finds the properties of a system involving a mass, spring, and damper. 
This project uses MATLAB to solve differential equations in order to analyze and visualize behaviors

Features
- Allows for custom values for mass, spring coefficient, damping coefficient, initial displacement, and intial velocity
- User determines time span of simulation
- Creates plots of displacement over time, velocity over time, and total energy over time
- Determines key values such as maximum displacement, maximum velocity, oscillation frequency, and stopping time

How To Use
- Run main.m in MATLAB
- Follow the input prompts
